            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>ONE LAWYER</h1><p>The lawyer makes sure filing deadlines are known and rights preserved. Any lawyer who provide One Lawyer services have ten or more years of subject area practice experience and excellent credentials. Less experienced lawyers can act as One Lawyer if they consult with such an experienced lawyer as a mentor to review each significant legal issue. The highest standards of legal practice must be used and the lawyer has an ethical duty not to allow parties to abuse an imbalance of power or to reach illegal or unethical agreements.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/63973c384c13f41b4c51e4ecbb5df4746200930b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>At Ascher & Denton, we only practice Family Law. </h1><p>If you think that we are simple folk who only do the same thing over and over, think again. Each family is different from all others and different at each moment in the process of change while going through the trauma of a family law case. Family law also most always includes vital decisions on most other areas of law - especially bankruptcy, tax, employment, housing, criminal, and business law. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/278e3bc4921700de940937f295a3dc3b3736357b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
