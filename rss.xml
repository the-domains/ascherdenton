            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>At Ascher & Denton, we only practice Family Law. </h1><p>If you think that we are simple folk who only do the same thing over and over, think again. Each family is different from all others and different at each moment in the process of change while going through the trauma of a family law case. Family law also most always includes vital decisions on most other areas of law - especially bankruptcy, tax, employment, housing, criminal, and business law. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/278e3bc4921700de940937f295a3dc3b3736357b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
