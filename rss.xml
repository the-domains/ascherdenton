            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1></h1><p>This focus is not about being cheap, it is about providing the best value and doing things right with long term consequences in mind. Litigation is exhausting and expensive and we avoid wasted time and avoid hurting anyone's feelings as much as possible. It is just the right way to do family law.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/47e76110a36f5f7e62e1227dfd9a3a4e468a002a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We only practice Family Law. </h1><p>Many attorneys run screaming rather than practicing in this area of law because it takes a special kind of personality (not common among those who become lawyers) to communicate compassionately with very upset people. Not only is it vital for us to understand and help emotionally distressed people, but we have to keep a professional distance from their problems so we can be a smart outsider who does not just tell you what you want to hear. When done well, it is very satisfying work for us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8bb92131a8b7998e6882d2dc4818413d8a365b4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
