Divorce

We focus on helping you figure out what your best options are and cut your losses when making decisions about your divorce, including fair distribution of assets, division of the marital home, child support payments and child custody rights. (In Washington, Divorce is called Dissolution of Marriage and Child Custody is called Parenting Plan) 

Alimony 

Reasonable spousal support is sometimes appropriate in a divorce. Attorney fees awards are sometimes involved to help a less financially able spouse have a lawyer. We work within the boundaries of the law to help get spousal support established in a reasonable amount and for a reasonable length of time so both parties can go on with their lives with dignity. 

Child custody and visitation 

Washington law protects the constitutional rights of both parents to parent while the primary basis for all decisions about parenting plans is always "the best interest of the child" standard. Our law firm tries hard to work with our client and the court (and the other side, when possible) to reach toward the very best parenting plan solutions for both parents to have appropriate and meaningful contact with their children. 

Child support 

Washington State Laws provide for a standard set of guidelines for parents to provide support for their children. It is an art, not an automatic result, to work within these guidelines to insure that children are supported in the correct way as intended by the law. We focus on obeying the law and getting to a reasonable result that both parents can live with to support their children. It is important to do an intelligent cost benefit analysis in every case and for you to make informed decisions for past/present and future support and interest that may be owed. Child support modification and enforcement Child support payments do not change unless the court or administrative process modifies the child support order. If either the custodial or the noncustodial parent experiences a significant change in circumstances, our attorneys can guide you through the proper legal procedures to modify your child support payments accordingly. 

Mediation 

Mediation puts the decisions in your hands and can often provide more expedient, predictable results than a trial. Much of the time, we resolve family law cases outside of court.
