# One Lawyer Services 

ONE LAWYER is an intelligent and cost effective way to resolve a disagreement with a guarantee of no court battles. Both sides get help from one lawyer to learn all of the legal advice either side would have received if they had come in to meet separately with the lawyer. This does not create a conflict of interest because both sides agree to the process in the first place and the attorney is neutral, giving all legal advice and information to both sides at all times. 

After the legal advice is provided, the lawyer acts as a mediator to help the parties negotiate settlement of all issues they need to resolve. At the parties' request, the lawyer will also provide advice like a Settlement Conference Judge and give the parties an idea what a ruling from the bench would be for a difficult issue. When agreements are reached, the lawyer creates and files any legal documents needed to finalize resolved issues. In the unlikely event that the issues can not be resolved with One Lawyer services, the right to hire separate lawyers and go to court is preserved. The lawyer makes sure filing deadlines are known and rights preserved. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2865c127-f5b5-4715-a916-b9345126ce9d.jpg)
