# **ONE LAWYER**

# 

is an intelligent and cost effective way to resolve a disagreement with a guarantee of no court battles. Both sides get help from one lawyer to learn all of the legal advice either side would have received if they had come in to meet separately with the lawyer. This does not create a conflict of interest because both sides agree to the process in the first place and the attorney is neutral, giving all legal advice and information to both sides at all times.

The lawyer makes sure filing deadlines are known and rights preserved. Any lawyer who provide One Lawyer services have ten or more years of subject area practice experience and excellent credentials. Less experienced lawyers can act as One Lawyer if they consult with such an experienced lawyer as a mentor to review each significant legal issue. The highest standards of legal practice must be used and the lawyer has an ethical duty not to allow parties to abuse an imbalance of power or to reach illegal or unethical agreements.

One Lawyer can be used for many different areas of law and is particularly appropriate when people or companies don't want to make their issues a matter of public record more than necessary, such as in a business contract dispute, family law matter, or a neighborhood issue where privacy and ongoing relationships should be preserved.

Some folks who now choose to represent themselves in court to save lawyer battle fees and/or the ugliness of hiring lawyers to fight each other, would be much better served with One Lawyer. One Lawyer services are not available everywhere. Clients want One Lawyer and are surprised when they learn that it may be difficult to find. It just makes so much sense to have one lawyer help both sides. While the Sage Lawyer may charge more per hour (and take fewer hours to accomplish things), the cost savings of sharing the cost of the lawyer services and avoiding court battles make this one of the least expensive ways to use an attorney. One Lawyer services are also sometimes available for a set fee instead of pay by the hour.
