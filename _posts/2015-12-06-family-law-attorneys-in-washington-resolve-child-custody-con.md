Mediation: a tool for cooperation 

Children are best served when parents maintain a cordial relationship. Through the structured process of mediation, parents can set aside enmity and agree on key points concerning their children. Mediation can be a highly effective tool, helping you preserve your children's well-being and the stability of their lives during the turbulent process of divorce. The predictability of mediation reduces the stress of child custody conflicts and puts important child-rearing decisions in your hands, rather than in the hands of the court. Attorneys at Ascher & Denton, PLLC expertly guide negotiations towards a settlement that protects your child's best interests and your parental rights.

The uncertainty of litigation can add to the stress and upheaval of this time. But with an experienced Ascher & Denton family law attorney by your side, you can feel confident that your children will be protected and your parental rights remain secure.
