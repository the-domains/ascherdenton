Our goal is that respect be maintained between parents throughout a negotiation, and that agreement be reached amicably.

Family law attorneys at Ascher & Denton, PLLC have more than 25 years of experience in child custody matters. We stand by your side on all issues of child custody and visitation, including extensive knowledge about:

**Mediation: a tool for cooperation**

Children are best served when parents maintain a cordial relationship. Through the structured process of mediation, parents can set aside enmity and agree on key points concerning their children. Mediation can be a highly effective tool, helping you preserve your children's well-being and the stability of their lives during the turbulent process of divorce. The predictability of mediation reduces the stress of child custody conflicts and puts important child-rearing decisions in your hands, rather than in the hands of the court. Attorneys at Ascher & Denton, PLLC expertly guide negotiations towards a settlement that protects your child's best interests and your parental rights.
