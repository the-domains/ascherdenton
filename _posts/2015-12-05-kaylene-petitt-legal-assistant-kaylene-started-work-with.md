# **Kaylene Petitt, Law Clerk**

Formerly Legal Assistant (2008-2015)

Now a Law Clerk (2015-2019)

Future Attorney (in about 2020)

In Janurary of 2008, Kaylene started as a legal assistant with Ascher & Denton. Armed with her Bachelor's Degree from The Evergreen State College, emphasizing United States History and Visual Arts and great life skills, Kaylene has blossomed in her law office careers. Through many life changes and through many many residence moves, Kaylene has been a crucial part of the Ascher & Denton team. Kaylene's compassionate and careful, clear approach to helping clients and helping to run the business side of this firm make her a wonderful asset and a really enjoyable person to get help from.

In mid 2015, Kaylene started her four year course of study as a Law Clerk (with Melissa Denton's mentoring) to become an attorney with this firm.

She also enjoys cooking and sharing delicious food, taking pictures of her cat, and being a newlywed.

# **James Ascher, Retired Attorney**

Jim Ascher and Melissa Denton joined their individual law firms in 1995\. At their first business meeting, Jim made a solemn announcement: "We have good news and we have bad news." Melissa asked for the good news. "The good news is - we qualify for food stamps."

Fortunately, Jim was kidding and a very enjoyable law practice has continued ever since. Jim is still in touch frequently, but he retired fully from the practice of law at the end of 2014\.

Jim's former careers in network news and with the US Foreign Service certainly added spice to the mix and his wise advice and good humor still add to the quality of this law firm.

# **Traci Zawlocki, Books & Business**

Traci came to work with Ascher & Denton in 2015, in the nick of time. She has an accounting degree and is a registered agent with the IRS and knows all things numbers and business finance. Her part time work to help keep the Ascher & Denton ship running right is greatly appreciated and her abilities with calculating may be called upon even more in the future as we make sure to get the numbers perfectly right in every case as well as in our business operations.
