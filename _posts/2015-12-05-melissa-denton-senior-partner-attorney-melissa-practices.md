Bar Affiliations: Thurston County (Member, Family Law Section; Former President and Founding Member of Thurston County Young Lawyers) and Washington State (Former Member, Board of Trustees, Young Lawyers Division) Bar Associations. Melissa's focus is on helping folks who want to resolve their cases with a minimum of ugly court action. While the courts are useful when folks just can't agree, it is so much wiser to handle personal family issues privately and with a minimum of expense when reasonable agreements can be reached. When the court is needed, Melissa tries to keep that expensive alternative to a minimum so that families can begin to heal in a new form rather than being further damaged by the adversarial process required in court. Melissa has pioneered a new way of practicing law, called One Lawyer, and also began a business called AdvantageDenton.com which finds the right lawyer for clients. Melissa represented a client from the beginning of a divorce though two appellate court cases and up through the Supreme Court of Washington in a very important case called In re Marriage of Rideout,. 150 Wn.2d 337, 359, 77 P.3d 1174 (2003) Melissa has been married since 1987 and has a teenage son who plans to be a lawyer, heaven help us all. Melissa's family is in Oklahoma and her husband's family is in Malaysia, so they travel a lot. Melissa got her black belt in Shorin Ryu Karate right before starting law school. It helped. .
