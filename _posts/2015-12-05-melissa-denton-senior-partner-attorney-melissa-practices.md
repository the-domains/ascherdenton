Melissa Denton is the founding partner and senior lawyer at Ascher & Denton. She has practiced family law in Thurston County since 1990\.

Melissa's focus is on helping folks who want to resolve their cases with a minimum of ugly court action. While the courts are essential and necessary when people just can't agree, it is so much wiser to handle personal family issues privately and with a minimum of expense when acceptable agreements can be reached. When the court is needed, Melissa tries to keep that expensive alternative to a minimum so that families can begin to heal in a new form rather than being further damaged by the adversarial process required in court.
