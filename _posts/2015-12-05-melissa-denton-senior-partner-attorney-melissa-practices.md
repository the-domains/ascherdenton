**Melissa Denton** is the founding partner and senior lawyer at Ascher & Denton. She has practiced family law in Thurston County since 1990\.

Melissa's focus is on helping folks who want to resolve their cases with a minimum of ugly court action. While the courts are essential and necessary when people just can't agree, it is so much wiser to handle personal family issues privately and with a minimum of expense when acceptable agreements can be reached. When the court is needed, Melissa tries to keep that expensive alternative to a minimum so that families can begin to heal in a new form rather than being further damaged by the adversarial process required in court.

**One Lawyer**

Melissa has pioneered a new way of practicing law, called **One Lawyer**. Please be sure to check out the description of One Lawyer on our website if it is possible that both sides may have the trust and respect necessary to work together for an agreed resolution of your case.

**Famous Case**

Melissa represented a client from the beginning of a divorce though two appellate court cases and up through the Supreme Court of Washington in a very important case called _Rideout v. Rideout_,. 150 Wn.2d 337, 359, 77 P.3d 1174 (2003). This case, and many other cases Melissa has worked on, have enriched her perspective and the large amount of experience she can draw upon from practicing family law since 1990\.

Melissa has been married since 1987 and has a teenaged son who plans to be a lawyer, heaven help us all. Melissa's family is in Oklahoma and her husband's family is in Malaysia, so they travel a lot. Melissa got her black belt in Shorin Ryu Karate right before starting law school. It helped.
