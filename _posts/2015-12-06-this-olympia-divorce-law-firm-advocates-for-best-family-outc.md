Mediation gives you and your spouse the opportunity to negotiate a divorce settlement in a more amicable setting by working with a trained facilitator. The mediation process fosters cooperation between partners and produces less stress and hostility than is usually associated with litigation. Mediation often reduces the time and costs of divorce, and it puts the decisions in your hands. The experienced negotiators at Ascher & Denton, PLLC can help you obtain the most equitable divorce settlement, fair child support agreement and healthy child custody arrangement. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3507600e-25ed-4219-81e8-573edb329e6d.JPG)
