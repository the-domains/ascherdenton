Melissa's focus is on helping folks who want to resolve their cases with a minimum of ugly court action. While the courts are useful when folks just can't agree, it is so much wiser to handle personal family issues privately and with a minimum of expense when reasonable agreements can be reached. When the court is needed, Melissa tries to keep that expensive alternative to a minimum so that families can begin to heal in a new form rather than being further damaged by the adversarial process required in court.

Melissa has pioneered a new way of practicing law, called One Lawyer Services, and also began a business called AdvantageDenton.com which finds the right lawyer for clients.

Melissa represented a client from the beginning of a divorce though two appellate court cases and up through the Supreme Court of Washington in a very important case called _In re Marriage of Rideout_,. 150 Wn.2d 337, 359, 77 P.3d 1174 (2003)

Melissa has been married since 1987 and has a teenage son who plans to be a lawyer, heaven help us all. Melissa's family is in Oklahoma and her husband's family is in Malaysia, so they travel a lot. Melissa got her black belt in Shorin Ryu Karate right before starting law school. It helped.
