We only do family law

Many attorneys run screaming rather than practicing in this area of law because it takes a special kind of personality (not common among those who become lawyers) to communicate compassionately with very upset people. Not only is it vital for us to understand and help emotionally distressed people, but we have to keep a professional distance from their problems so we can be a smart outsider who does not just tell you what you want to hear. When done well, it is very satisfying work for us.

Family law specifically includes many kinds of cases, including (but not limited to):

Divorce; Child Custody; Child Support; Collaborative Law; Settlement Law; Alimony; Annulment; Cohabitation Agreements; Collaborative Family Law; Community Property Law; Divorce Arbitration; Divorce Mediation; Divorce Taxation; Domestic Partnerships; Domestic Relations; Domestic Violence; Equitable Distribution; Family Arbitration; Family Mediation; Gay and Lesbian Family Law; International Family Law; Interstate Support; Marital Agreements; Marital Property Distribution; Marital Property Law; Marital Property Settlements; Matrimonial Law; Military Divorce; Non-Traditional Family Law; Paternity; Post Divorce Modification; Postnuptial Agreements; Premarital Agreements; Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs); Restraining Orders; Separation Agreements; Spousal Support; Uncontested Divorce
