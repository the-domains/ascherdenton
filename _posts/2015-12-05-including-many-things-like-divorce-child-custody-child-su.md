At Ascher & Denton, we only practice Family Law. Many attorneys run screaming rather than practicing in this area of law because it takes a special kind of personality (not common among those who become lawyers) to communicate compassionately with very upset people (often the definition of people going through divorce or other custody/family legal problems). Not only is it vital for us to understand and help emotionally distressed people, but we have to keep a professional distance from their problems so we can be a smart outsider who does not just tell you what you want to hear. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea934dd7-1474-4c8f-a4fa-d279465a3f75.JPG)

If you think that we are simple folk who only do the same thing over and over, think again. Each family is different from all others and different at each moment in the process of change when going through the trauma of a family lw case. Family law also always includes vital decisions on most other areas of law - especially bankruptcy, tax, employment, housing, criminal, and business law. 

Family law specifically includes many things like: Divorce; Child Custody; Child Support; Collaborative Law; Settlement Law; Alimony; Annulment; Cohabitation Agreements; Collaborative Family Law; Community Property Law; Divorce Arbitration; Divorce Mediation; Divorce Taxation; Domestic Partnerships; Domestic Relations; Domestic Violence; Equitable Distribution; Family Arbitration; Family Mediation; Gay and Lesbian Family Law; International Family Law; Interstate Support; Marital Agreements; Marital Property Distribution; Marital Property Law; Marital Property Settlements; Matrimonial Law; Military Divorce; Non-Traditional Family Law; Paternity; Post Divorce Modification; Postnuptial Agreements; Premarital Agreements; Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs); Restraining Orders; Separation Agreements; Spousal Support; Uncontested Divorce

We are not just trying to toot our horn. Don't blame yourself if this is hard to go through. We are here to help and we make it as smooth and simple as we can while helping you to make the choices that will work out best for you and your loved ones in the long run while getting you through the immediate tough times in the best available way.
